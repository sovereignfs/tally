# AGENTS.md

Guidance for every AI agent working in this repository (Codex reads this file directly; Claude Code loads it through `CLAUDE.md`). It is
the one copy of the conventions. Do not duplicate them elsewhere, and do not add task history or release narrative to it: those belong
in `ROADMAP.md`, the task's epic and the PR body.

This repository follows the conventions of [`sovereignfs/sovereign`](https://github.com/sovereignfs/sovereign) (its `AGENTS.md`,
`docs/building-an-app.md` and `docs/development-workflow.md`) and of [`sovereignfs/tusk`](https://github.com/sovereignfs/tusk) (its `AGENTS.md`,
the closest model: an app of its own built from a roadmap, whose offline Desk is the shape of Tally's sync). Where this file is silent, do what Tusk
does; where they differ, this file says which.

## What this is

**Tally**, an app of the Sovereign suite exactly as Tusk, Fjord and Ledger are: money shared between people, in groups, with balances per currency,
payments recorded to settle up, and expenses that can be recorded offline and sync in the background. A Sovereign instance can host it, and **it runs
fully on its own, with every feature, needing no instance**: its own accounts, people, mail and notices. It replaces the legacy plugin
`sovereignfs/sovereign-plugin-tally`, whose behaviour is the starting point and none of whose code, data or interface is carried over. It is a PWA on
Next.js, with its own database (sqld, a SQLite file or PostgreSQL), signing people in locally, through a Sovereign core, or both, from one image.

**Nothing is built yet.** `DESIGN.md` is the design, `ROADMAP.md` the order, and Milestone A starts by copying Tusk's infrastructure (`DESIGN.md`
§5.1).

## Source of truth

Read the relevant document before a task. Where two disagree, the earlier one wins and the later one is stale and should be fixed:

1. **The contracts Sovereign publishes**, in the `sovereign` repository: `contracts/app-manifest.md`, `contracts/env.md`, `docs/using-the-sdk.md` and
   `docs/specs/sdk.md`, `docs/specs/design-system.md` and `docs/design-system.md`, `docs/connecting-an-app.md`. A gap is raised in `sovereign`, not
   patched here.
2. **`DESIGN.md`**: what Tally is and how it is built, with numbered sections that tasks cite.
3. **`ROADMAP.md`**: the order of work, one row per task, canonical for status.
4. **`docs/epics/`**: each task's detail (goal, "Accepts when", and once done, how it was done and what was left out).

Directories are created when they are needed. Research (`docs/research/`), RFCs (`docs/rfcs/`), ADRs (`docs/adrs/`) and workstreams
(`docs/workstreams/`) are used as Sovereign and Tusk use them. A documented "not now" is a valid outcome.

## Planning workflow

- **The developer assigns the task** at the start of a session. There is no "next task" pointer in any file; read `ROADMAP.md` for the queue and ask
  which to pick up.
- **Task IDs are permanent** (`4.3`): use them in cross-references and dependency lists, never in branch names, commit messages or PR titles.
- **A finished task is marked done in its roadmap row and written up in its epic** (Done as: what, where, what was left out), in the same change as
  the work.
- **Copying from Tusk or Ledger is said, not hidden:** a task that copies a file names it in its Done as, and changes in behaviour are stated.
- **Epic 14 is work in `sovereign`;** a Tally task that depends on it waits for the published release.

## Working conventions

- **One task, one branch, one draft PR.** Branch from an up-to-date `main`, named `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>` or `chore/<slug>`. Do not
  start a second task on a branch whose PR is not merged.
- **Nothing goes to `main` directly,** except the owner's bypass, which is theirs to use.
- **Never commit or push without being asked.** Prepare changes in the working tree and stop.
- **Commits explain why.** `type(scope): summary` under 72 characters, body wrapped at 100, a `Verified:` line naming what was run, one logical change
  per commit. Every commit an agent makes ends with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>`: model-agnostic, never a specific model
  name.
- **PRs target `main`, are opened as drafts** (`gh pr create --draft --base main`), and are marked ready only on instruction. The body says what changed
  and why, cites the `DESIGN.md` section, carries no task numbers, and ends with `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`.
- **Merge with rebase and merge,** never squash and never a merge commit. **Never merge a PR automatically.**
- **Verify before claiming done.** Run the commands under Commands and show the output. A regression test is trusted only after it has been seen to
  fail against the code it guards.
- **Docs are part of the change.** A statement a change makes false is fixed in the same PR; a change to behaviour adds a line under `## [Unreleased]`
  in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Releases are their own PR,** as Tusk's: `scripts/release.sh`, a `vX.Y.Z` tag publishes the image. A patch has no migration and no setting change.
- **Flag Docker-config impact immediately:** a new setting, port, path or native dependency updates the `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` in the same
  change.

## Rules of an app

Tusk's rules, as they apply here, and Tally's own. They describe the app as `DESIGN.md` designs it.

- **Every feature works with no Sovereign instance.** Core adds a way in, a directory, a bell and email; a feature that only works with core is not
  done. A call to core that fails, is refused or is not supported changes nothing but that call (`DESIGN.md` §14.5).
- **An account is known by its better-auth user id (`account_id`); someone in a group is a `person`.** Every account has exactly one person; a
  placeholder is a person with no account. Names are read from `person`, never from the auth store. A `sub` is identity; an email is never matched to
  an account or a person at sign-in.
- **An email is shown only to whom `DESIGN.md` §6.1 allows,** through the one visibility function, and never in a notice, an activity line or another
  person's export.
- **Everything personal of an account is removed by `People.deletePerson`** (`src/sovereign/people.ts`), which keeps only the name on the shared
  record, safe to run twice. **A new table is handled there, and exported and imported, in the same change,** with a test that seeds one of each.
- **Every row of a group carries `group_id`, and the permission is in the statement:** active membership of the group as a condition of the same query
  (`DESIGN.md` §5.2), never checked first and then touched; an owner's operation adds the role to it. Anything a change points at must be the same
  group's, in the same statement. **A refusal reads as not found.** A route, operation or mutation finds the session first, checks `Origin` on a write,
  is listed in `src/access/routes.ts`, and has a test calling it as a second person.
- **What people write in a group is sealed on the device** (`DESIGN.md` §5.3): a group's name, descriptions, notes and comments travel and are stored
  only as one sealed blob per row under the group's key, through `src/cipher/` (Tally's own; nothing of it is copied). Tally is never called
  "zero-knowledge". The server never holds a key that opens them, and never puts sealed text in a
  log, a mail or a call to core. Nobody is asked to handle a key: a new device unlocks with the password or passkey that signs it in, the browser never sends the password
  itself, and the recovery key is offered, never required.
- **Every member hears of a group's changes by default;** each chooses per group (`member.notify`), and the server works out who is involved.
- **Money is integer minor units of its currency, always** (`DESIGN.md` §8.7). No floating point touches an amount. **Nothing converts between
  currencies, and no figure blends two.**
- **A split has one rounding rule,** `src/money/split.ts`, used by the browser, the server, the seed and import; the server recomputes shares and
  refuses a mutation whose shares differ.
- **A balance is derived, never written.** Every figure of who owes whom comes from `src/balances/`, and every spending figure from `src/insights/`:
  pure, shared by the screens, the server and the tests; one figure has one implementation.
- **Expenses, payments and comments are written only through the one path:** an action in `src/actions/` makes the mutation, and `src/sync/apply.ts`
  applies it, re-checking membership, the group's state and the arithmetic, in one short transaction that increments the group's `seq` and writes the
  revision and activity. A replayed mutation writes nothing. The property tests pass.
- **An edit replaces the whole expense or payment and never loses the version it replaced** (`revision`). Nothing anyone typed is thrown away: a
  refused change goes to Couldn't sync, never to nowhere.
- **Membership, groups and invitations are online operations** (`/api/ops`), decided by the server at once. They are not queued offline in phase 1.
- **The device's store is per account and holds only the account's groups;** it is deleted at sign-out. **The service worker caches the shell only,**
  by allow-list; no page or answer with a person's data is ever in a cache.
- **Notices are raised in the change's transaction, never for the person who acted.** Mail goes through `mail_outbox`, in the background; no address
  or content is logged.
- **An invitation token is random, stored only as its hash, compared in constant time,** single-use and expiring; every invalid link shows the same
  page.
- **A job claims its work in the database** and is safe to run twice and from two processes.
- **Logs hold no amounts, descriptions, notes, comments, names or addresses:** an id and a kind of failure.
- **The database has three forms and two dialects:** a schema and migrations per dialect, generated with `pnpm db:generate`, never written by hand or
  `push`ed; standard SQL, values bound; no `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, trigger, extension or foreign key; every deletion names what it deletes, in a transaction;
  short transactions, nothing held across a call to core or SMTP. A data-layer test runs on sqld, a `file:` database and PostgreSQL. **Tests read
  `TALLY_TEST_*` and never the app's variables.**
- **A released migration is never edited:** a fix is a new migration.
- **A credential (core's refresh token) is stored only through `src/crypto/`** (envelope encryption under `TALLY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`). Secrets never appear
  in an error, a log, a URL or the browser.
- **The manifest is the one copy** (`sovereign.manifest.json`) of what an instance reads. `pnpm manifest:check` passes, and the image is built with
  `pnpm exec sovereign-manifest docker-args`. The port is 3004 everywhere.
- **Environment variables carry the prefix `TALLY_`,** declared once through `@sovereignfs/config`; every one is in `.env.example`; the server refuses to
  start on a wrong setting; no secret has a default; never `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for a value that varies at run time.
- **The design system is imported from `@sovereignfs/ui` directly,** pinned exactly; style with `--sv-*` tokens only; Hanken Grotesk served by the app.
  **Reusable UI is built in `@sovereignfs/ui` in `sovereign`, released, then used** (epic 14), never forked here.
- **Never fork a navigation decision by viewport;** fork only what is rendered.
- **No third-party loads and no third-party requests from the browser.** What people write is rendered as text, never as HTML.
- **User-facing words are "expense", "payment", "settle up", "you owe", "owes you", "not on Tally yet", "app"** (`DESIGN.md` §4), never "settlement",
  "debt simplification", "guest", "debit", "credit", "client" or "plugin".
- **Next.js tracks the latest stable release.** Read the guide bundled with the installed version (`node_modules/next/dist/docs/`) before writing
  Next code.
- **TypeScript is strict.** No `any` without a comment; prefix an intentionally unused identifier with `_`; never disable a lint rule inline without a
  comment.

## pnpm

As Tusk's: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` for every routine install; `pnpm-workspace.yaml` carries pnpm's settings and the Dockerfile copies it;
pnpm refuses a release less than a day old and an install script nobody decided on; an exception in `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` only for a package of
ours, exact-pinned. Never accept pnpm's offer to add one.

## Commands

None exist yet. Milestone A brings Tusk's set (`format`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `db:generate`, `db:dev`, `seed`, `boot-check`, `e2e`,
`manifest:check`, `build`, `scripts/deploy-check.sh`), and this list is where they are written as they land. Until then, `verify` means the Markdown is
formatted and every relative link resolves.

## Layout

`DESIGN.md` §5.1 is where things go as the app is built. Today the repository holds only `DESIGN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/epics/` and this file.
