// `pnpm dev`: the development server, with the settings it needs made for you the first time.
//
// A fresh checkout has no settings, and the app's defaults are an operator's (an sqld service that is not running, and no way to sign in), so `next dev`
// alone stops at start-up. This writes `.env.local` once, for this machine only, and then starts `next dev` on port 3004:
//
//   - a SQLite file under ./data, which needs no Docker (`pnpm db:dev sqld | postgres` is for trying the other forms);
//   - the address people use, http://localhost:3004, which sign-in is made from;
//   - local sign-in, with a secret made here and never written anywhere else.
//
// `.env.local` is not tracked by git (`.env.*` is ignored) and is **never overwritten**: once it exists it is yours, and a value you put in your own shell
// wins over it, as Next does. Delete it to start again. Nothing else in the repository reads it but Next, and CI and the tests read the environment alone.
