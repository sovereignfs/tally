/**
 * Regenerates `src/money/currencies.ts` from the Node runtime's own ICU database: `pnpm generate:currencies`, then commit the result.
 *
 * Generated-then-committed, not read from ICU at runtime, for three reasons: the table is then deterministic rather than varying with whichever ICU the
 * server and the browser each happen to carry; it is reviewable in a diff; and the client bundle gets a plain array instead of depending on
 * `Intl.supportedValuesOf`.
 *
 * ICU is the source for codes, display names and, most importantly, each currency's own fraction digits, which are not uniformly 2: ISO 4217 gives JPY, KRW,
 * CLP and ISK zero, and BHD, KWD and TND three. Getting those from ICU rather than by hand is the point of generating this.
 *
 * **Fiat only** (DESIGN.md §8.7): no crypto in phase 1, so nothing is appended. The two codes ICU lists that are not a currency anyone holds are left out: the
 * IMF's Special Drawing Right and the Sucre, a unit of account between ALBA's members.
