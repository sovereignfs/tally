 * **No navigation or data decision is forked by viewport** (DESIGN.md §15.11): the same addresses and the same data at every width, and only what is drawn
 * differs. A width is asked for by `useIsMobile`, `matchMedia` or `innerWidth`, and only the files below may (each draws something differently and decides
 * nothing else); a new file that asks must be added here, which is where someone looks at whether it is a rendering choice. And none of these may navigate or
 * fetch on the strength of it. The shell draws its two navigations and lets its stylesheet show one, so it appears in no list.
