 *
 * 1. The settings are checked, and a wrong one stops the server, naming it.
 * 2. The database is provisioned, opened and migrated (DESIGN.md §19.1), and the server does not start if it cannot. It waits for one that is
 *    still starting, up to TALLY_DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS, since in a compose file the app and its database come up together.
 *
 * The background jobs (task 1.6) start after it.
